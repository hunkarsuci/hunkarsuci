## About Me

I am an aerospace engineering master’s student with a strong focus on **Guidance, Navigation & Control**

My work lies at the intersection of **theory and implementation** developing estimation and control
algorithms, building simulation and test frameworks, and validating systems with a strong engineering mindset.

- 🔬 Working on **optimization-based Visual–Inertial Odometry (VIO)**
- ✈️ Creating **synthetic UAV trajectories, simulators, and avionics test tools**
- 🧠 Strong interest in **sensor fusion, estimation consistency, and control**
- 🔧 Hands-on experience with **embedded systems, hardware–software integration, and test automation**
